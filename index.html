The Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.</p>

                Headquartered in Bengaluru, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of the Government of India whose vision is to “harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research & planetary exploration”. Earlier, ISRO was known as the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which was formed under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962.

To do this around the Earth, it must be on a free trajectory which has an altitude at perigee (altitude at closest approach) around 80 kilometers (50 mi); this is the boundary of space as defined by NASA, the US Air Force and the FAA. To remain in orbit at this altitude requires an orbital speed of ~7.8 km/s. Orbital speed is slower for higher orbits, but attaining them requires greater delta-v. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. </p>

                India’s Moon mission Chandrayaan-3 scripted history by successfully landing on the lunar surface at 6:04 pm on August 23. With the Lander accomplishing a ‘soft landing’ on the Moon’s south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so. A rover, which is a small vehicle that is meant to move around on the Moon’s surface, then came out of the Lander. On August 24, ISRO released a video of how this happened on X.
